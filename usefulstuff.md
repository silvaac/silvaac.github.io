# Material from ARPM bootcamp (2015)

I have attempted to put together all matlab code, publications and slides from Attilio Meucci's [ARPM Bootcamp](https://www.arpm.co/bootcamp/). The materials are on [github](https://github.com/silvaac/symmys). I have also added R code from [R-forge meucci package](https://r-forge.r-project.org/scm/viewvc.php/pkg/Meucci/?root=returnanalytics).
