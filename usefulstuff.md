# Material from ARPM bootcamp (2015)

I have attempted to put together all matlab code, publications and slides from Attilio Meucci's [ARPM Bootcamp](http://www.symmys.com/arpm-bootcamp). The materials are on [github](https://github.com/silvaac/symmys). I have also added R code from [R-forge meucci package](https://r-forge.r-project.org/scm/viewvc.php/pkg/Meucci/?root=returnanalytics). 

This is a simple Shiny application to simulate market invariants: [Monte Carlo Simulation](http://52.25.23.86:3838/probProcesses/)
