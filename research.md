# Mathematical formulation of trading strategies

## Time-series momentum (trend-following)

Proposed prototipical trend-following strategy which average performance and standard deviation of the performance admits a close form solution. 

Initial results were presented at [R/Finance 2013](http://www.rinfinance.com/RinFinance2013/agenda/) held at [UIC](http://business.uic.edu/recruiterscompanies/icfd). 

Latest version was presented at [QCMC 2015](http://www.mpipks-dresden.mpg.de/~qcmc15/) held at the [Max Planck Institute for complex systems](http://www.mpipks-dresden.mpg.de/index_en.html). 

The presentation slides with few interactive plots created using [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) can be found at this link [QCMC15](http://52.24.173.190:3838/QCMC15).

The latest preprint can be found [here](http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.3030) or [here](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2396099).

## Momentum

Traditional momentum involves a portfolio of assets therefore cross-correlation between assets is important.
