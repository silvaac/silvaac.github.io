# Artificial data generation

The generation of realistic symulated data is of considerable importance in a large set of reaserch areas. In finance and economics, the use of simulated data goes from senario generatio for streess tests, asset pricing and risk control to name a few. The following article intruduces a novel algorithm to generate artificial data applied to the S&P500.

# Math formulation of trading strategies

## Time-series momentum (trend-following)

Proposed prototipical trend-following strategy which average performance and standard deviation admits a close form solution. 

Initial results were presented at [R/Finance 2013](http://www.rinfinance.com/RinFinance2013/agenda/) held at [UIC](http://business.uic.edu/recruiterscompanies/icfd). 

Latest version was presented at [QCMC 2015](http://www.mpipks-dresden.mpg.de/~qcmc15/) held at the [Max Planck Institute for complex systems](https://www.mpipks-dresden.mpg.de/). 

The presentation slides with few interactive plots created using [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) can be found at this link [QCMC15](https://idatafactory.shinyapps.io/QCMC15).

Final article has been accepted for publication in [Quantitative Finance](https://doi.org/10.1080/14697688.2017.1417621). The most recent [preprint](trendF.pdf) has been substancialy extended, edited and updated.

## Momentum

Traditional momentum involves a portfolio of assets therefore cross-correlation between assets is important. We are looking into formulations that describe such correlations and their significance.
